Fixie builders frequently face the problem to choose a **gear ratio** (i.e. the number of chainring teeth divided by the number of cogring teeth) that provides them with as many skid patches as possible.


This `App` calculates the optimal chain- and cogring teeth combination in terms of **skid patches** for a given gear ratio. The result is sorted descendingly first by the number of skid patches and secondly by the desired gear ratio.
