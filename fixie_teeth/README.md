fixie\_teeth
============

Fixie builders frequently face the problem to choose a gear ratio (i.e. the number of chainring teeth divided by the number of cogring teeth) that provides them with as many skid patches as possible. For instance, choosing 40 teeth for the chaingring and 20 teeth for the cogring, is one of the worst possible combinations since it gives you only a single skid patch. The skid patch is where the tire soon wears off. Naturally, it is much better for the longevity of your tire to choose a teeth combination with as many skid patches as possible. This App does exactly that. It calculates the optimal combination of chainring and cogring teeth for a given gear ratio within a specified gear ratio tolerance range (default: desired gear ratio +/- 0.1). The result is a table with a combination of chain- and cogring teeth sorted descendingly first by the number of skid patches and secondly by the desired gear ratio.
